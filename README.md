# Medical-Insurance-Cost-Prediction-Using-Linear-Regression
This project focuses on predicting medical insurance costs based on a variety of factors, including age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region of residence. Using Python's data analysis libraries, the dataset was examined, cleaned, and visualized to explore patterns that impact insurance charges. After preprocessing the data, a Linear Regression model was developed to predict insurance costs, which could be used by insurance companies to assess potential charges based on personal attributes. The model's performance was evaluated using the R-squared metric to ensure reliable predictions on new data.
